# f1-elo-system

This fun project constructs a very simple ELO system for Formula 1 drivers that
compares drivers with their team mates and opponents from other constructors, taking
into account differences in constructors' car quality, to determine who
is the greatest Formula 1 driver of all time. 

The data used to run this system is provided by [Vopani](https://www.kaggle.com/rohanrao) and available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020). Big thanks to him for collecting and sharing the data.
